# Functional neural correlates of useful field of view (UFOV) performance in youth clinically recovered from concussion and uninjured controls 

This project is used to find neural correlates of Useful Field of View (UFOV) and Dual Task Screen (DTS) with the BRAINY finger tapping and resting state scans

Order of running the scripts:
1) FileMigration.py
2) TruncateScan.m
3) batch_propreprocess_list.m (from CNIR-fmri-preproc-toolbox)
4) PostProcessList.py
5) batch_postprocess_list.m (from CNIR-fmri-preproc-toolbox)
6) FD_calculation.m
7) batch_FunctionalConnectivity_"AtlasName".m
